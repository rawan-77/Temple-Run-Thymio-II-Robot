# Temple-Run-Thymio-II-Robot
A program (using ASEBA) that allows Thymio II robot to navigate a temple maze and get to a treasure room by scanning barcodes on the walls of the maze. Barcodes resemble instructions such as which direction to go and what color to light up.

## How the code works in the simulator
This video shows how the code works in the simulator. It does not light up at the hazard lines and it does not stop at the circle in the treasure room like it should because at the time of making this video, these two features were not added to the code yet. However, these two features are now present in the code.
